# fucklearn
A project for a lecture slide reader
Fucklearn is sth I came up with during lectures. Sometimes a professor's presenting speed is way over the students' comprehension speed. Students tend to use learning ChatGPT to assist their learning, but oftentimes, our screenshot speed is not even close to the lecture progress.
In addition to that, we do have problems of interacting with individual lectures' slides and discussing big or small topics instead of having unrelated slides occupying the model context. So I decided to use fucklearn.
